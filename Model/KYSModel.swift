///
/// Models the "Know Your Status" interaction flow, where the user is prompted to update thier HIV status.
///
/// The application interacts with the model by calling the public methods (check, update, save, cancel).
/// The model publishes events which the application should observe and respond to by updating the view
/// state. See KYSEvent for a description of the events posted by the model, and the recommended behaviour
/// for the application.
///
/// Usage:
///   * Observe events by setting a callback on the `onEvent` method.
///   * Call  `check()` method to check the user's status. If the user's status is up to date, the `upToDate` event is
///     posted. If the user's status is outdated, the `prompt` event is posted and the app should display a UI to
///     prompt the user to update their status.
///  *  When showing the prompt UI, the user can choose to update their status or opt out for the moment. The
///     application should call `cancel` to `postpone` the update, or call `update()` to proceed to updating the
///     status.
///  *  When showing the status update screen, the user can save the updated status or cancel the update. The
///     application should call `save()` to save the status, or call `cancel()` to end the update process.
///
/// Usage example:
///     let model = KYSModel()
///     model.onEvent = { event in
///         switch event {
///             case .check:
///                 // Raised when calling `check()`.
///                 break
///             case .upToDate:
///                 // Raised after calling `check()` and the user's status does not need to be updated.
///                 // KYS status does not need to be updated.
///                 break
///             case .prompt:
///                 // Raised after calling `check()` and the user's KYS status needs to be updated.
///                 // Show a dialog or alert to prompt the user to update their status.
///                 // Call `update()` to proceed to updating the status.
///                 // Call `cancel()` to opt out.
